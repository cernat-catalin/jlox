## From book
- Add support for C-style `/* ... */` block comments.
- Add support for C-style comma expressions (comma operator in expressions).
- Add support for C-style ternary operator.
- Add error production rules to handle each binary operator without a left-hand operator.

## Other
- `Scanner` is kind of state based. Can we reduce that?
